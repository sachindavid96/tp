### Project: Mycelium

**Mycelium** is a desktop application aimed at helping **freelance web developers
manage clients and projects** from multiple online sources like [Upstack](https://upstackhq.com/),
[Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/), and [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/). All interactions
with **Mycelium** are done through text commands or HotKeys, enabling one to efficiently
manipulate data while availing oneself to the convenience of viewing, offered by the
Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. The application is written in Java.


* **New Feature**:`I did not add any new features as I was responsible for repurposing the
existing Parser in the AddressBook application to support Mycelium's commands that used dashes
instead of slashes to specify arguments in the commands

* **Code contributed**: My code contributions can be accessed through this link: https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2023-02-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=sachindavid96&tabRepo=AY2223S2-CS2103T-W14-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false

* **Project management**: I created some of the belonging to other
team membmers in the issue tracker 

* **Enhancements to existing features**: The existing parser was repurposed to support the 
commands of Mycelium, by changing the slashes (used to specify arguments) to dashes so that
it bears more resemblance to the command line argument flags that are widely in use today.
I also wrote the classes for the new commands (creating and deleting of projects and clients)l

* **Documentation**:
    * **Contributions to UG**: I added some of the Frequently Asked Questions and identified 
  some grammatical errors in the User Guide
    * **Contributions to DG**: I am responsible for changing the existing diagrams and explanations about
  how parsing works to be specific to the Mycelium application

* **Community**: `to be added`
